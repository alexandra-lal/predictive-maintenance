# Predictive Maintenance Model
This project demonstrates a Predictive Maintenance machine learning model that identifies whether a machine is likely to fail based on real sensor data.

The model uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on industrial IoT sensor readings such as air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear.

# Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Encoded categorical features (machine type)  
   - Split dataset into training and test sets (80/20)  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Algorithm: `RandomForestClassifier`  
   - Trained using 8000 records  
   - Evaluated on 2000 test samples  

3. **Performance**  
   | Metric | Score |
   |:-------|:------|
   | Accuracy | **98.4%** |
   | Precision | 0.99 (class 0), 0.84 (class 1) |
   | Recall | 1.00 (class 0), 0.59 (class 1) |

4. **Feature Importance**  
   - The most influential features:  
     - **Torque (Nm)**  
     - **Rotational Speed (rpm)**  
     - **Tool Wear (min)**

# Insights

Through this project, I explored how machine learning can anticipate equipment failures before they happen â€” reducing downtime and optimizing maintenance schedules.  

- The **Random Forest** model delivered strong accuracy (98.4%) and excellent precision, showing it can reliably distinguish between normal and at-risk machine states.  
- **Torque**, **rotational speed**, and **tool wear** emerged as the most significant indicators of potential failure.  
- The model slightly underperformed on minority (failure) cases, suggesting future improvements with resampling or cost-sensitive learning techniques.  
- The analysis demonstrates how predictive maintenance can directly translate to operational efficiency and cost savings in industrial environments.
